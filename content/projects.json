      "status": "MVP",
      "tags": ["Policy", "Calculator", "US States"],
      "oneLineProblem": "State-by-state leave rules make income planning opaque and stressful.",
      "problem": "Parents planning maternity leave struggle to estimate time off and income impact because US state rules vary, benefits include caps and eligibility constraints, and existing calculators are either generic or too complex.",
      "targetUser": "Expecting parents in the US who want clear, deterministic estimates and a transparent explanation of what drives the gap.",
      "solution": "A stateless calculator that resolves state policy defaults, applies caps, and returns a paid vs unpaid timeline, cashflow gap, assumptions, and next checks. Optional narration is feature-flagged and never changes numbers.",
      "architecture": "Modular calculation pipeline: resolve scenario defaults, validate and apply caps, compute timeline and cashflow, then generate structured explanations. Policy configs live in a US-first directory with a generic fallback and one fully implemented state.",
      "decisions": "Keep logic pure and testable in a domain layer; no accounts or persistence; LLM narration is optional and post-processed with number allowlists to prevent hallucinated figures.",
      "nextSteps": "Ship US-GENERIC plus one real state policy, add unit tests for caps and timelines, and expand states via config-only additions.",

      "tags": ["Agentic", "Companion", "Safety"],
      "oneLineProblem": "A quiet companion for the invisible load of early postpartum life.",
      "problem": "The silent crisis of postpartum mental labor: in the first year postpartum, many mothers feel overwhelmed or not coping despite doing everything right. Existing tools optimize the baby or diagnose mental health, but do not help name the invisible emotional and cognitive load. A single prompt cannot safely deliver the empathy and guardrails required.",
      "targetUser": "Mothers in the first postpartum year who want language and validation for what feels heavy, without judgment or medical framing.",
      "solution": "A calm, journal-like companion that labels the emotional load using six grounded categories and returns a brief, validating response. The output avoids advice, avoids diagnosis, and focuses on making the user feel seen.",
      "architecture": "Single-line agentic flow with three nodes: Safety Gatekeeper (binary high-risk scan with early exit), Taxonomy Classifier (maps input to one of six PRD categories), and Validation Writer (quiet, minimal, non-prescriptive response). Configuration lives in JSON brains (safety.json, classifier.json, writer.json) after prototyping in the Antigravity sidebar.",
      "decisions": "Moved from AI as assistant to AI as companion; rejected single-prompt approaches due to task dilution; enforced strict guardrails (no advice, minimal word count, no diagnosis) to keep tone safe and soothing.",
      "nextSteps": "Refine taxonomy grounding, expand scenario coverage, and validate the quiet-space UX with additional user sessions.",

      "problem": "Most personal sites bury the work under heavy visuals or vague language.",
      "targetUser": "Teams and collaborators who want a fast, clear overview of real work.",
      "solution": "A minimal, static-first portfolio with structured content and optional narration.",
      "architecture": "Static HTML routes with JSON content, lightweight JS, and a narration stub.",
      "decisions": "Prioritized load speed and clarity over complex interactivity; no heavy frameworks.",
